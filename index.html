<p>2.6. You confirm that You have read, fully understood and accepted the Risk Disclosure Statements set out herein.


<p>3. RISK DISCLOSURE
<p>3.1. Due to our internal policies, We only provide the Services to users with sufficient experience, knowledge and understanding of the work principles of our Technology Platform, and those who fully understand the associated risks. You acknowledge and agree that you shall access and use the Technology Platform at your own risk. The risk of loss in Trading crypto assets can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such Trading is appropriate for you in light of your circumstances and resources. You acknowledge and agree the possibility of the following:
 <p>a. You may sustain a total loss of the crypto assets in your MkwayExchange Account, and, in some cases, you may incur losses beyond such crypto assets.
 <p>b. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example, when the market reaches a daily price fluctuation limit ("limit move") and there is insufficient liquidity in the market.
 <p>c. Placing contingent orders, such as "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.
 <p>d. All crypto assets positions involve risk, and a "spread" position may not be less risky than an outright "long" or "short" position.
 <p>e. The use of leverage can work against you as well as for you and can lead to large losses as well as gains.
 <p>f. All of the points noted above apply to all crypto assets. This brief statement cannot, however, disclose all the risks and other aspects associated with the Trade of crypto assets and shall not be considered as any professional advice.

<p>3.2. Risks Associated with the Internet-based Trading System. You acknowledge that there are risks associated with utilizing an Internet-based trading system including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware, software, and Internet connections. You acknowledge that MkwayExchange shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Technology Platform, howsoever caused.

<p>3.3. Margin Disclosure Statement. The risk of loss in financing a transaction by deposit of collateral is significant. You may sustain losses in excess of your Crypto assets deposited as collateral with the Technology Platform. Market conditions may make it impossible to execute contingent orders, such as "stop-loss" or "stop limit" orders. You may be called upon at short notice to make additional margin deposits or interest payments. If the required Margin deposits or interest payments are not made within the prescribed time, Your collateral may be liquidated without your consent. Moreover, You will remain liable for any resulting deficit in your account and interest charged on it. You should therefore carefully consider whether such an arrangement is suitable and responds your situation and objectives.

<p>3.4. Risks Associated with the Blockchain Protocol. The Technology Platform and its related Services are based on the Blockchain protocol. As such, any malfunction, unintended function, unexpected functioning of or attack on the Blockchain protocol may cause the Technology Platform to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner.

<p>3.5. Risks Associated with Blockchains and Crypto Assets. You acknowledge and accept that the MkwayExchange has no control over any cryptocurrency network and you understand all risks associated with utilizing any crypto assets network, including, but not limited to the risk of unknown vulnerabilities in or unanticipated changes to any network protocol. We will not be responsible for any harm occurring as a result of such risks.

<p>3.6. No Control Over Your Own Actions. As defined in the foregoing cl. 4.3 (g) and other provisions herein YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD MKWAYEXCHANGE HARMLESS AGAINST ANY CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION, IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ORIGINATED FROM OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR USE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE ARISING FROM YOUR PERSONAL ERROR AND MISBEHAVIOR SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS, INCORRECTLY CONSTRUCTED TRANSACTIONS, LOSS OF YOUR ACCESSES ETC.

<p>3.7. Price Accuracy. Although we enforce strict price accuracy policies for all fiat providers and do our best to ensure that the content displayed on or via our Platform is up-to-date and accurate, we cannot guarantee the reliability or accuracy of such content.

<p>3.8. No Control Over Third-Party Services. If you encounter any problems with any Third-Party Services available via MkwayExchange, you acknowledge that you should resolve that issue with the relevant third-party or fiat provider and that your sole remedy in such circumstances lies within the relevant third-party and not within MkwayExchange.


<p>4. CRYPTO ASSETS PROTECTION
<p>4.1. We strive to protect your crypto assets from unauthorized access, use, or spending. We use a variety of physical and technical measures designed to protect our systems and your crypto assets. By remitting your crypto assets to MkwayExchange Account you entrust and entitle Us to ultimately take decisions on the safety and security of your crypto assets.

<p>4.2. We reserve the right to take different measures of protection, which include, but are not limited to a diversification of crypto assets in different allocations whether on a segregate record (account) or not.

<p>4.3. Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed as a willingness to a seizure of your crypto assets. The main purpose of this section is to notify you about different measures of protection, that We use to keep your crypto assets safe.


<p>5. ELECTRONIC NOTICES
<p>5.1. Consent to Electronic Delivery. You agree and consent to receive electronically all Communications, that MkwayExchange may be willing to communicate to you in connection with your MkwayExchange Account and/or use of the MkwayExchange Services.

You may contact Us through our Support Center (https://support.mkwayexchange@gmail.com) to request electronic copies of Communications.

<p>5.2. Withdrawal of Consent. You may withdraw your consent to receive electronic Communications by sending a withdrawal notice to support. If this is a case you waive your right to plead ignorance. If you decline or withdraw consent to receive electronic Communications, MkwayExchange may suspend or terminate your use of the Technology Platform.

<p>5.3. Updating Contact Information. It is your responsibility to keep your email address on file with MkwayExchange up to date so that MkwayExchange can communicate with you electronically. You understand and agree that if MkwayExchange sends you an electronic Communication but you do not receive it because your email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive electronic Communications, MkwayExchange will be deemed to have provided the Communication to you. You waive your right to plead ignorance. Please note that if you use a spam filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email address book, you must add MkwayExchange to your email address book so that you will be able to receive the Communications We send you. If your email address becomes invalid in a such way that electronic Communications sent to you by MkwayExchange are returned, MkwayExchange may deem your account being inactive, and you may be not able to complete any transaction via the Technology Platform.


<p>6. SPECIAL CONDITIONS
<p>6.1. Transfer confirmation. Once your Deposit/Withdrawal request or Trade order is executed, a confirmation will be electronically made available via Technology Platform detailing the particulars of the Transfer. You acknowledge and agree that the failure of the Technology Platform to provide such confirmation shall not prejudice or invalidate the terms of such transaction.

<p>6.2. Conditions and Restrictions.

<p>6.4. No financing obligation. You fully agree and accept, that the Technology Platform will not at any time be obliged to provide or continue to provide any Margin Facility to You.

<p>6.5. Cancellations. You may only cancel a Transfer request initiated via the Technology Platform if such cancellation occurs before MkwayExchange executes the Transfer. Once your Transfer request has been executed, you may not change, withdraw or cancel your authorization for MkwayExchange to complete such Transfer. If a Trade order has been partially filled, you may cancel the unfilled remainder unless the order relates to a market rate Trade. We reserve the right to refuse any cancellation request associated with a market rate Trade order once you have submitted such order. While We may, at our sole discretion, reverse a Trade under certain extraordinary conditions, a customer does not have a right to a reversal of a Trade.

<p>6.6. Insufficient Crypto Assets. If you have an insufficient amount of crypto assets in your MkwayExchange Account to complete a Transfer via the Technology Platform, We may cancel the entire order or may fulfill a partial order using the amount of crypto assets currently available in your MkwayExchange Account, less any fees owed to MkwayExchange in connection with our execution of the Transfers.

<p>6.7. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the Transfers you complete via the Technology Platform, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that MkwayExchange is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transfers or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any Trades and Transfers and does not act as your tax agent.

<p>6.8. Feedbacks. We own exclusive rights, including all intellectual property rights, to Feedback. Any Feedback you submit is non-confidential and shall become the sole property of MkwayExchange. We will be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of such Feedback for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you. You waive any rights you may have to the Feedback (including inter alia any copyrights). Do not provide Feedback if you expect to be paid or want to continue to own or claim rights on it; your idea might be great, but We may have already had the same or a similar idea and We do not want disputes. We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any content posted by you constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their right to privacy. We have the right to remove any posting you make on our website if, in our opinion, your post does not comply with the content standards set out therein.


<p>7. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION OF YOUR MKWAYEXCHANGE ACCOUNT
<p>7.1. In case of your breach of the Terms, or any other event as We may deem necessary, including without limitation market disruption and/or Force Majeure event We may, in our sole discretion and without liability to you, with or without prior notice:

 <p>b. any loss or damage arising from a Force Majeure Event.

<p>8.7. We strive to protect our users from fraudulent and scam activities in crypto assets sphere. It is possible that some crypto assets are purposed for unlawful seizure of the property, or are construed as a fraud, scam or any other activity, recognized by the laws as illegal and/or non-compliant with legal requirements. We reserve the right to prohibit and discontinue any transactions on our Technology Platform with such crypto asset at our sole discretion, without any prior notice to you and without publication of the reason for such decision, whenever this comes to our knowledge. YOU INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HIT TECH SOLUTIONS DEVELOPMENT LIMITED HARMLESS AGAINST ANY CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS OR LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, ORIGINATED FROM OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH PROHIBITION AND DISCONTINUATION OF TRANSACTIONS IN OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM WITH ANY CRYPTO ASSET.

<p>8.8.

<p>8.9. The User shall not have any right or claim against the Technology Platform in respect of any loss arising out of any sale, realization, redemption, liquidation or disposal or proposed sale, realization, redemption, liquidation or disposal of the Crypto assets due to the User’s inability to maintain the Margin or meet the Margin calls, however such loss may have been caused, and whether or not a better price could or might have been obtained by either deferring or advancing the date of such sale, realization, redemption, liquidation, disposal or otherwise.

<p>8.10. THE USER UNDERTAKES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS HARMLESS FOR ANY LOSS, COSTS, CLAIM, LIABILITY OR EXPENSE ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH ANY BREACH BY THE USER OF ITS OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER INCLUDING ANY COSTS REASONABLY AND NECESSARY INCURRED BY THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM.


<p>9. NO OFFER OF SECURITIES
<p>9.1. MkwayExchange endeavors all possible measures to be sure that crypto assets that are available via the Technology Platform cannot be classified as "security" by any competent national authority. Moreover, MkwayExchange represents that it never intended or desired to make tokens and/or coins that can be classified as "security" available via Technology Platform.

<p>9.2. The responsibility for the fact that the instrument cannot be treated as “security” lies with the owner of token and/or coin. If there is any risk or speculations that token and/or coin can be treated as “security”, the Technology Platform reserves the right to prohibit and discontinue any transactions on our Technology Platform with such tokens and/or coins at its sole discretion.

<p>9.3. We follow the best practices to decide whether crypto asset is security or not. However, We give no warranty and/or investment, financial, legal or any other professional advice, that any crypto asset available via our Technology Platform is not a security.

<p>10.1.
